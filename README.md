# [SDF05] Project Brief: Blackjack Game on GitHub

In this project, you will dive into creating a Blackjack game, a popular card game, using Scrimba. By the end of this course, you'll have built a fully functional game and deepened your understanding of JavaScript, including arrays, loops, and objects. Additionally, you'll be guided through basic best practices for mini-game development and user experience enhancement.

## Project Overview

With this project I followed along the scrimba course at https://scrimba.com/playlist/p3py7U7
The objective was to create a browser based version of the popular casino card game, BlackJack.

## Challenges Faced

Overall I think this is one of my favourite projects we've done so far. It wasn't as difficult to me as some of the others, but I feel that is in large part due to completing the practice 2 and practice 3 Javascript courses on scrimba. I enjoyed this course and I must say a lot of the Javascript came intuitively. Again I believe this is a combination of practice with the prior courses and perhaps some of it due to my prior exposure to python. 
I did however struggle at times, but most of that was due to misspelled variables, stray braces, or not fully understanding how a range/index or certain operator works in Javascript. 
I thought this was excellent practice for the language and upon completing the course I feel a lot more comfortable with Javascript as a whole, partly due to the wide range of different aspects of the language that we covered.

## Final Thoughts

I must say I am happy with the finished product, and I do see the potential for making it better once I am more knowledgable with Javascript as a whole. There could be the potential to introduce a dealer to play against to make the game more competitive or perhaps add the functionality that an ace can act as a one or an 11 depending on the choice of the player. Having said that, I am happy where I am leaving the project now as this was an excellent exercise in getting familiar and comfortable with the Javascript syntax.
